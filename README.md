Current Status
---------------
Feather is still a WIP that has not yet reached v0.1. I hope to release v0.1 sometime in 2016. Below is a list of tasks to be completed for the v0.1 release.
* Finish up Keyframe Editor
* Add DopeSheet Editor
* Undo/Redo system
* Finish up nodes

Introduction
---------------
Feather3D is for artists that want a tool that can be modified to suit their needs. Feather's strength is in it's scenegraph where everything is driven by nodes. These nodes are easy to make yourself and there is no need to know, or build, the feather application in order to make your own; someone with moderate C++ experience should be able to create their own with little effort. Feather's interface is built off of Qt's QML language making it very easy to modify. And, if you would like to get rid of the interface all together, you can also do that and create your own from scratch. Feather was originally started as a clone of Wings3D but the inclusion of the node based scenegraph made it possible to easily add in animation tools as well so some Maya influences have been added.
